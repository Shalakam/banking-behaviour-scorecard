# Banking behaviour scorecard

Predicting the credit risk of the customers with savings account in the bank.

## Getting Started

The objective is to build a banking behaviour scorecard model for bank's internal customers through a user's liability account and predict the credit risk.

**Key**

- The data is of low transacting customers
- Customer risk profile means the probability of the customer defaulting on his EMI.
- *Evaluation:* F1-Score

### Prerequisites

Things to install prior to using the notebook.

```
numpy,pandas,matplotlib,seaborn,pytorch,xgboost
```

**Data description**

- Total variables: 2395
- Col1: ID
- Col2: Target Variable

**What you will learn**

- Handling huge number of columns
- Working with imbalanced data
- Feature selection
- Dimensionality reduction
- Algorithms - XGBoost, Catboost, and LightGBM
- Oversampling techniques such as SMOTE, SVM SMOTE, Borderline SMOTE, and ADASYN.
